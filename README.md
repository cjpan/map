# Map project
This is a map example for my [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com) **Front End Web Developer Nanodegree**.

This is a single-page application featuring a map of restaurants in Enoshima, Kanagawa, Japan.
Application works with Foursquare and Google Map API.

## Application
To load application user should double click on index.html file.
Users can see a **Google map** with some location markers on the map after the application is loaded.
When users click any markers, the marker will bounce and an information window will pop up and show the venue's information.

There is also a list of these venues in the left.
When users hover over any items in the list, the marker will bounce to show where it is in the map.
when users click any items in the list, an information window will pop up and show the venue's information.

Users can type a keyword in a search field to filter these venues.
